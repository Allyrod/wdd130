    <h2>Aly</h2>
    <p> As mentioned above, my name is Alyssa. I am so excited to be here taking this class, I am currently majored in Software Development and so far I have been loving it.
         My plan after I get my degree would be to find a job that  I can do from home. I want to be at home more so I can be more envolved with my family.
         This one of the main reason I decided to get into programing. It pays well and you can do it from anywhere. 
         I am not currently working in my carrer field cause as you can see I am still finishing that degree lol.
         I  have been working at a local digital markerting company for 2 years and I have been enjoying it a lot.
         I am married to my best friend and we have a beautiful 5 year old.
    </p>
    <p> I have been a member all my life. I love the gospel and all the blessings and joy it brings me. I currently have a calling in church as a primary activites leader.
        It's so fun working with the primary kids, I have always loved being around them and being a part of thier growth. I love my calling. 
        The gospel has always brought my joy and happiness. I have had so many experiences that have testified to me that this church is true.
        I love our prophet and I sustain him and all our chursch leaders. the gospel has been the best thing in my life.
    </p>
    <p> I love doing so many things. My favorite thing to do in this whole world is travel. My love for traveling is unlike any other LOL. 
        We are going to our very first cruse trip in November, we are so excited! We are goign to saty 8 days and stop at some amazing ports. 
        I am very happy to be here and to learning with you all.
